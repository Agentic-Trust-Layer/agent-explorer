## ERC-8092 ontology (`ERC8092.owl`)

Source: `apps/badge-admin/public/ontology/ERC8092.owl`

### Relationship assertions

ERC-8092 is modeled as:

- **Relationship**: `agentictrust:Relationship` (persistent relationship instance)
- **RelationshipAssertion**: `agentictrust:RelationshipAssertion` (constitutive assertion)

ERC-8092 adds concrete subclasses and fields.

class "agentictrust:Relationship" as Relationship
class "agentictrust:RelationshipAssertion" as RelationshipAssertion
class "erc8092:ERC8092Relationship" as ERC8092Relationship
class "erc8092:ERC8092RelationshipAssertion" as ERC8092RelationshipAssertion
class "erc8092:RelationshipAccount" as RelationshipAccount
class "erc8092:RelationshipRevocationAssertion" as RelationshipRevocationAssertion
class "prov:Agent" as provAgent

ERC8092Relationship --|> Relationship
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --|> RelationshipAssertion
RelationshipRevocationAssertion --|> RelationshipAssertion

RelationshipAssertion --> Relationship : assertsRelationship (agentictrust)

ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> provAgent : initiator
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> provAgent : approver
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> RelationshipAccount : initiatorAccount
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> RelationshipAccount : approverAccount
provAgent --> RelationshipAccount : ownsRelationshipAccount
RelationshipRevocationAssertion --> RelationshipAssertion : revocationOfRelationshipAssertion
```

### Key identifiers (datatype properties)

- On the relationship instance:
  - `erc8092:relationshipId`
- On the relationship assertion:
  - `erc8092:relationshipAssertionId`
- On relationship accounts:
  - `erc8092:relationshipAccountId` (and alias `erc8092:accountAddress`)
