### Relationship assertions

ERC-8092 is modeled as:

- **Relationship**: `agentictrust:Relationship` (persistent relationship instance)
- **RelationshipAssertion**: `agentictrust:RelationshipAssertion` (constitutive assertion)

ERC-8092 adds concrete subclasses and fields.

class Relationship["agentictrust:Relationship"]
class RelationshipAssertion["agentictrust:RelationshipAssertion"]
class ERC8092Relationship["erc8092:ERC8092Relationship"]
class ERC8092RelationshipAssertion["erc8092:ERC8092RelationshipAssertion"]
class RelationshipAccount["erc8092:RelationshipAccount"]
class RelationshipRevocationAssertion["erc8092:RelationshipRevocationAssertion"]
class provAgent["prov:Agent"]

ERC8092Relationship --|> Relationship
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --|> RelationshipAssertion
RelationshipRevocationAssertion --|> RelationshipAssertion

RelationshipAssertion --> Relationship : assertsRelationship (agentictrust)

ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> provAgent : initiator
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> provAgent : approver
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> RelationshipAccount : initiatorAccount
ERC8092RelationshipAssertion --> RelationshipAccount : approverAccount
provAgent --> RelationshipAccount : ownsRelationshipAccount
RelationshipRevocationAssertion --> RelationshipAssertion : revocationOfRelationshipAssertion
```

### Key identifiers (datatype properties)

- On the relationship instance:
  - `erc8092:relationshipId`
- On the relationship assertion:
  - `erc8092:relationshipAssertionId`
- On relationship accounts:
  - `erc8092:relationshipAccountId` (and alias `erc8092:accountAddress`)
