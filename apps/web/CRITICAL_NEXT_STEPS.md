# Critical Next Steps to Fix Cloudflare Pages Deployment

## Current Situation

✅ Build works locally  
✅ Files upload successfully  
❌ **Site returns 404 on Cloudflare Pages**

## Why This is Happening

Cloudflare Pages has TWO ways to deploy Next.js:

1. **Native Next.js Support** (Recommended)
   - Cloudflare auto-detects Next.js from your files
   - Requires proper configuration in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Framework preset must be set correctly

2. **Static File Hosting**
   - Just serves files from `.next` directory
   - Does NOT understand Next.js routing
   - Returns 404 because it doesn't know how to handle routes

**YOUR ISSUE**: You're deploying to option #2 (static files), but Cloudflare doesn't recognize it as a Next.js app.

## Solution

### Option A: Fix Dashboard Configuration (EASIEST)

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Pages** → **erc8004-web**
2. Click **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
3. **CRITICAL CHECKS**:
   - Framework preset: Should say "Next.js" (not blank or "Other")
   - If it's wrong, click **Edit** and select "Next.js"
   - Build output directory: `.next`
   - Click **Save**
4. Click **Deployments** → **Retry deployment** on latest one
5. Wait for build to complete
6. Check site

### Option B: Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages

If Option A doesn't work, implement the adapter (already started):

```bash
cd /home/barb/erc8004/erc-8004-identity-indexer
pnpm install
cd apps/web
pnpm exec @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

This creates `.vercel/output/static/` directory that Cloudflare understands.

Then deploy:
```bash
wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name=erc8004-web
```

## What to Do RIGHT NOW

**PRIORITY 1**: Check Cloudflare Dashboard build configuration
- Is "Framework preset" set to "Next.js"?
- Share a screenshot or tell me what it says

**PRIORITY 2**: Check latest deployment logs
- Click on the latest deployment
- Share any errors from the build logs

## Why This Matters

If the framework preset isn't "Next.js", Cloudflare treats your app as static files. It won't:
- Handle Next.js routing
- Run server components
- Process App Router
- Execute middleware

This results in 404 errors for all routes.

## Quick Check

Open this URL and tell me what it shows:
```

```

Specifically, screenshot or copy the "Build configuration" section.
