# Root Cause Analysis: Why Cloudflare Pages Returns 404

## Current Status

✅ Build completes successfully  
✅ `.next` directory has valid files  
✅ Wrangler uploads 112 files successfully  
❌ All deployments return 404  
❌ Custom domain returns 404  

## The Problem

Next.js 14 with App Router is **NOT natively supported** by Cloudflare Pages without special configuration.

Cloudflare Pages can:
- ✅ Serve static files
- ✅ Run Cloudflare Workers
- ⚠️ Has **beta/experimental** Next.js support
- ❌ Does NOT run Node.js by default
- ❌ Does NOT support full Next.js server-side rendering

## Why 404?

Your Next.js app is built for **Node.js runtime**, but Cloudflare Pages runs on:
- **Edge Runtime** (Workers) - no Node.js APIs
- **Static hosting** - just files, no server

When Pages receives the `.next` directory:
1. It doesn't recognize the Next.js App Router structure
2. It doesn't know how to run `page.js` files
3. It looks for `index.html` but the routing doesn't work
4. Returns 404

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages (Recommended)

Cloudflare has an official Next.js adapter:

```bash
npm install @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

Then configure `next.config.mjs`:
```javascript
import withCloudflare from '@cloudflare/next-on-pages/with-cloudflare';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // ... your existing config
};

export default withCloudflare(nextConfig);
```

Update build command:
```bash
npm run build && npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

Update `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
pages_build_output_dir = ".vercel/output/static"
```

### Solution 2: Static Export (Simpler)

If you don't need server-side rendering:

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export', // Generate static HTML
  // ... rest of config
};
```

Build command stays the same, outputs to `out/` directory.

Update `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
pages_build_output_dir = "out"
```

**Limitation**: API routes won't work with static export.

### Solution 3: Hybrid Approach

Keep API routes as Cloudflare Workers:
1. Static export the frontend (`output: 'export'`)
2. Deploy API routes separately as Workers
3. Point API calls to Worker URLs

## Recommended Next Steps

**Option A: Implement @cloudflare/next-on-pages** (Full Next.js support)  
**Option B: Use static export** (Simpler, but limited)

## Which to Choose?

**Use `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` if**:
- ✅ You need API routes
- ✅ You need server-side rendering
- ✅ You want full Next.js features

**Use static export if**:
- ✅ You only need static pages
- ✅ API routes already work as separate services
- ✅ Simpler deployment is priority

## Current App Analysis

Looking at your app:
- You have API routes (`/api/agents`, `/api/stats`, etc.)
- These already use `fetch` to GraphQL (good!)
- You use `'use client'` components (good!)
- Minimal server-side rendering

**Recommendation**: Use **@cloudflare/next-on-pages** for full compatibility.

## Implementation Steps

1. Install: `pnpm add @cloudflare/next-on-pages`
2. Update `next.config.mjs` with adapter
3. Update build script
4. Update `wrangler.toml` output dir
5. Rebuild and deploy
