# CHECK YOUR CLOUDFLARE DASHBOARD NOW

## Critical Action Required

To fix the 404 errors, we need to check your Cloudflare Dashboard configuration.

## Go To

**Cloudflare Dashboard**:
https://dash.cloudflare.com/

**Navigate to**:
Pages → erc8004-web → Settings → Builds & deployments

## Look For

**"Framework preset"** or **"Framework"** field

**Tell me what it says!**

## Most Likely Answers

- **"Other"** or blank → This is the problem! Change to "Next.js"
- **"Next.js"** → Different problem, need to see build logs
- **"Auto-detect"** → Should work, but maybe detection failed

## If Framework is Wrong

1. Click "Edit" or "Change" on Framework field
2. Select "Next.js" 
3. Save
4. Go to Deployments tab
5. Click "Retry deployment" on latest
6. Wait for build
7. Test site

## We Also Need

Latest deployment build logs:
- Go to: Pages → erc8004-web → Deployments
- Click on latest deployment
- Share any errors shown in build logs

## Once We Have This Info

We can fix it immediately!
