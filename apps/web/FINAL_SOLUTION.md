# Final Solution: Cloudflare Pages Configuration Required

## What We've Learned

✅ **Static HTML works** - Test page deployed successfully and shows content
❌ **Next.js App Router doesn't work** - Returns 404 even after removing .cfignore exclusions

## The Real Problem

Cloudflare Pages has TWO deployment modes:

1. **Static hosting** - Just serves HTML files (what we tested)
2. **Framework-aware hosting** - Understands Next.js routing (what we need)

When you manually deploy with `wrangler pages deploy .next`:
- Cloudflare receives the files
- But doesn't know it's Next.js
- Treats it as static files
- Can't handle App Router routing → 404

## The Solution

**Cloudflare Dashboard → Framework Detection**

Your project needs to be configured as a Next.js app in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

### How to Fix

1. **Go to**: Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → erc8004-web

2. **Click**: Settings → Builds & deployments

3. **Check**: "Framework preset" field
   - If blank or "Other" → **THIS IS THE PROBLEM**
   - Change to: **"Next.js"**

4. **Alternative**: If framework preset can't be set manually:
   - Cloudflare auto-detects from Git
   - Connect your Git repo to Cloudflare Pages
   - Let it build automatically from Git
   - This will detect Next.js correctly

5. **If using Git integration**:
   - Root directory: `apps/web`
   - Build command: As documented
   - Build output: `.next`
   - Framework: Auto-detect "Next.js"

## Why Manual Wrangler Deploy Fails

Manual deploys bypass framework detection:
- Files upload ✅
- Framework unknown ❌
- Routing fails ❌
- Returns 404 ❌

## What to Do Now

**Option 1: Use Git Integration (Recommended)**
- Connect repo to Cloudflare Pages
- Let it auto-detect Next.js
- Configure build settings
- Automatic deployments on push

**Option 2: Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages Adapter**
- Build with: `pnpm build:cloudflare`
- Creates `.vercel/output/static/`
- Deploy that directory
- Cloudflare understands this format

**Option 3: Configure Framework Preset Manually**
- If dashboard has this option
- Set to "Next.js"
- Then manual deploys might work

## Immediate Next Step

**CHECK CLOUDFLARE DASHBOARD NOW:**

Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
→ Pages → erc8004-web
→ Settings → Builds & deployments

**Share with me**:
1. Screenshot of build configuration
2. What "Framework preset" says
3. Latest deployment build logs

This will tell us exactly how to fix it!
